## Features

- **üß† Smart idle detection** with configurable timeouts
- **üéµ Media-aware idle handling** - automatically detects media playback
- **üö´ Application-specific inhibitors** - prevent idle when specific apps are running
- **‚è∏Ô∏è Idle inhibitor respect** - honors Wayland idle inhibitor protocols
- **‚öôÔ∏è Flexible action system** - supports named action blocks and custom commands
- **üîç Regex pattern matching** - powerful app filtering with regular expressions
- **üìù Clean configuration** - uses the intuitive [RUNE](https://github.com/saltnpepper97/rune-cfg) configuration language
- **üîß CLI options** - verbose logging, version info, and live config reloading
- **‚ö° Live reload** - update configuration without restarting the daemon

## Compositor Support

Stasis uses each compositor's native IPC protocol for app inhibiting functionality.

| Compositor | app_inhibit Support | Status |
|------------|-------------------|--------|
| Niri | ‚úÖ | Tested & Working |
| River | ‚úÖ | Implemented (see below) |
| Hyprland | ‚úÖ | Implemented |
| Others | ‚ùå | Send a PR! |

### River Support Notes

- **Limited window enumeration:** Unlike Niri or Hyprland, River does not provide a full IPC interface to list all windows. Stasis cannot reliably enumerate every active application via River.
- **Fallback mechanism:** When using River, Stasis falls back to process-based detection (sysinfo) for app inhibition.
- **Regex and app names may differ:** Because process-based detection relies on executable names and paths, some regex patterns or app IDs from Niri/Hyprland may not match exactly. Users may need to adjust inhibit_apps patterns for River.
- **Logging:** Stasis will log which apps were detected for inhibition, helping users refine their patterns.

> **Tip:** For best results with River, include both exact executable names and regex patterns for applications you want to inhibit.

**Want to add support for your compositor?** We welcome pull requests! Stasis integrates with each compositor's native IPC protocol, so adding support typically involves implementing the specific IPC calls for window/app detection.

## Installation

### Arch Linux (AUR)

## About RUNE

Stasis uses **[RUNE](https://github.com/saltnpepper97/rune-cfg)**, a configuration language designed to be simple but effective. RUNE features:

- **Clean, readable syntax** - Easy to write and understand
- **Variable support** - Define and reference variables
- **Nested configuration blocks** - Organize complex configurations
- **Array and string literals** - Flexible data types
- **Raw string support** - Use `r"pattern"` syntax for regex patterns
- **Comments** - Document your config with `#`
- **Type safety and validation** - Catch errors early
- **Metadata** - Use `@` symbol to denote metadata

## Contributing

- üìñ **Improve documentation** or add examples

### Adding Compositor Support

Want to add support for your favorite compositor? We'd love your help! Adding support typically involves:

1. Implementing the compositor's native IPC protocol
2. Adding window/app detection functionality
3. Testing with real applications
