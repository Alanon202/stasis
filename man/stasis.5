.TH STASIS 5 "2025-09-25" "Stasis 0.1" "User Manuals"
.SH NAME
stasis \- simple idle manager configuration for Wayland compositors

.SH SYNOPSIS
Stasis is configured via a Rune file (default: ~/.config/stasis/stasis.rune).
To run it automatically, add it to your compositor's autostart section (e.g., Niri, Hyprland, River).

.SH DESCRIPTION
Stasis monitors user idle time and can run commands on idle, suspend, or lock events.
It supports media monitoring and application-specific idle inhibitions.
Tested with the Niri compositor; idle app inhibition also works on Hyprland and River.

.SH CONFIGURATION
The configuration file is written in Rune. Key sections:

.TP
idle
Commands and behavior for idle state. Options:

.TP
resume_command
Command to run when activity resumes.

.TP
monitor_media
true/false to pause idle on media playback.

.TP
respect_idle_inhibitors
true/false

.TP
inhibit_apps
List of apps to ignore for idle. Supports literal names and Rust-style
regex patterns (handled by Stasis; Rune itself has no regex capabilities).
Currently, this feature only works on Niri, Hyprland, and River.

.TP
lock_screen
Section defining automatic screen locking:

.TP
timeout
Seconds before running the lock command.

.TP
command
Command to run (e.g., hyprlock).

.TP
suspend
Section defining automatic suspend:

.TP
timeout
Seconds before suspend.

.TP
command
Command to run (e.g., systemctl suspend).

.TP
custom_command
Optional section to define additional commands.

.SH FILES
~/.config/stasis/stasis.rune
: Default configuration file.

.SH EXAMPLES
Autostart Stasis in Niri (or other compositors):

.nf
# Add this line to your compositor's autostart config
exec stasis
.fi

Lock the screen automatically after 5 minutes of idle using Hyprlock:

.nf
lock_screen:
    timeout = 300
    command "hyprlock"
.fi

Suspend automatically after 30 minutes of idle:

.nf
suspend:
    timeout = 1800
    command "systemctl suspend"
.fi
